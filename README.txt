FEATURES:

 SSP image at the top - displays the total amount of packs used to get the amount of seeds combined (All amount fields : 5)
 WL image at the top - displays total wls gained if all sold 
 seeds - to put in the amount you have and what price you sell them 


HOW IT WORKS:

 when you press the "Calculate" button, a lot happens. it checks each field and looks at the amount and price. if the amount is set but the price not, the name of the item will
 be displayed at the top and the price field will turn red. the only value it will add is the total ssp used to get the amount of seeds, since it did cost packs to get them.


SOME TIPS:

 to get your total spend on ssp packs, know the rate you bought them for (like 200/14 === rate 14) and simply do the total ssp (displayed at top) : 200 x (rate).
 your profit would be:  TOTAL SPEND - TOTAL WLS IF SOLD. 

 you dont have to use this specificly for SSP. you can use this for other items if you ignore the images. lets say you sell something for 2 wls each, 
 you would just put 0.5 as the price (1 : WLS PER ITEM). if you want to know the total amount of items in stock just do the SSP amount x 5.
